# login_system\
what is this :
Login/Registeration system based on DataBase Project V2.1 (Consider reading readme-db.txt)

SO WHAT IS SO SPECIAL ABOUT THIS SYSTEM ANYWAY ?
- Well its not like any other sign up/in system based on relational or irreletional database 
- this is completely based on a database created by me (Consider taking a look on db.js and readme-db.txt)
- actullay this DB doesn't require any kind of local server (jsut like MySql) so it's kind of a good beggening in DBMS world 
 
 WHEN TO USE THIS DB ?
 - if you want to use a DB in your project quickly and don't want to worry about installation and knowing the SQL language 
 - if you are new to the world of DBMS and want to know how the work done

----------------------------
what's new in V1.3:

-server response 
-APIs to deliver information to the server
